# Perfectly-3lanced

This repository consists of three parts: 

A. Colab Notebooks: This folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks that our team used to train deep learning models. 
- Comparing_models.ipynb extracts data and compares different CNN models to choose the most potential one. 
- Final_code.inynb repeatedly runs the chosen model to find the set of weights with the best prediction.

B. SkyWatcher: This folder contains codes to deploy our model and the demo for the application. 
- ESP32 code: embedded microcontroller code. 
- modeldemo.csproj: uwp applications for testing the embedded model on an application

C. Perfectly 3lanced: demo application with webcam and commands to control servo
